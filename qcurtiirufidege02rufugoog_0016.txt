un work ‘De Gestis Alexandri Magni, regie Macedonum‚’ ie
ascribed in the manuscripts tc an author os the name os
ti Curtius Rufus. The flret two books are lost, aud the work,
as ithae come down to us, begine with the third. This acci·
dent hae deprived ue oi the prefaoe, which the author had un·
questionably prefixed to hie work, and in which he probably
aleo gave some scocum of himself sud his circumstances. In
addition tothie, it eo happens that no other ancient author
makes mention of thie Latin work ou the lise os Alexander-
a circumstance which occurs also in the case ol the ‘hetto
nomica’ os the post Manilius, and the ‘Historia Romana’ os
Velleius Paterculue. We cannot, therefore, say with any cer-
tainty who this Q Curtius Rufus, mentioned on the title-page,
really was, or at what time the book was written. In the work ’

iecit, however, we find sonte allusione to the time at which the -

author wrote: two passages which may admit of an extended
period-namely, iv. 20, where it is stated that Tyre, aster ite sall
under Alexander, wae in the enjoyrnent ol peacesul tranquillity,
under the protection of Roman clemenoy, by which everything
was resreshicg and renovating itsels during the bleseinge osa long
peece; and iv. te, where the author, in speaking os the Parthians,
says, that they, having immigrated from Scythia, now occupied

the country which at the time of the Persian monerohy was in· -

hebited by the Parthyaei. From this passage, however, we can
only inser that the work was written previous to the year sn.
aso, for in thet year the Parthian power in Asin was destroyed
by the rising of the new Persian Empire. Little, indeed, can be
gethered from these allusione concerning the period at which
this history of Curtius was written; but there ie a third passage
(x. 28) which throws more light upon the question3 sor there the
author explains how, aster the death os Alexander, when so many
