they were 01111010 1000111 origin, and consequently more legible.
The saults which were thus introduced throughout the text,
though they consisted only in single words and their arrange·
ment, have remained unexpunged until the most recent times,
although the desecta did 1101 escape the notice 01 learned edi·
1111, and many parts 01 the text were corrected, sometimes
by conjectures, but more frequently 110111 better manuscripts,

Asulanus (in the edition 01 Aldus, 1525), Hadrianus Junius
(1546),and1⁴'ranciscusMedius(1579). Theiremendetions,how·
ever, met with little confidence, because the 10000110 and sources
01 their corrections were but rerely and incompletely stated.
Hence otber editore, and among thern especially Freinsheim
(1040 end 1670), who has otherwise great 11101110, preferred re·
taining 1110 old and faulty text, and altering it only in such pes·
tages where it seemed indispensahly necessary. Owing 10 0
feeling 01 reverante 101 Freinsheim, 1110, text 00 constituted by
him remained unchanged 111 the large edition 01 Snalrenburg
(Dellt and Leyden,172⁴l); and cn the whole, in all the subse·
quent editions also, although the faulty nature 01 the vulgate ⁴
became more end more obvious by comparing several ancient
and good manuscripts. Schmieder (Gdttingen, 1803) was the
first who restored a much more correct tert, though 110 did not
act consistently throughout, his explanatory notes in Latin aleo

The present editor first published en edition 01 Curtius (Berlin,
1826), in which, with 1110 assistance 01 111010 manuscripts 111011
any 01 1110 predecessore had made use 01, he restored the text,
00 101 00 possible, 01 1110 genuine and urradultcrated manuscripts
01 1110 first class. In the commentaryto 1110 great edition (Brunc-
wiclr, 1849),110 has stated 1110 10000110 and sources 01 011 the

changes he has made in the 10111, giving 01 1110 001ῃο111110 a com·

and the early editions. The critical reader is thereby enabled
