PREFAOE.

Tu present work of Q Curtius Rufus has corne down to us in·
complete-the ilrst two books, and some portione in the middle
and near theend,being wanting in allthe manuscripts. It would
seem that the ancient copyist, who considered the lirst two books,
containing the lise and exploits of Alexander mainly alter hie
entering Asia, to be less necessary or interesting, commended
transcribing at the third book, when Alexander having gained
the victory on the Granicus, had already obtained a firm footing
, in Asiaand was entering upon bis successful career, conquering
countries which bad never before been the sceneos Greek mili·
taryenterprise. The other gaps in the work have been fitted up
in modern editions, aa in the present, by the supplements os the
learned Freinsheim; so that the history· ol' Alexander is con·
tinued uninterruptedly down to the point to which Curtius inss
tended to carry it-narnely, te the establishment of a regency
aller the death cs the conqueror. The sant thet the same gepa
occur in all manuscripts, justifies the interanea, that the manu·
scripta known to exist, and the number os which is eighteen,

’ are derived from one and the earne, which hes thus become the

mothercodex lor all the others. The copies, however, present
great differeuces in detail; lor towards the eud os the middle
ages, the textos curdus was subjected to a thorough revision by
a scholar who was very elever, but at the earne time olleu too
bold, and from this revised copy others again were made, partly
with new emendations, and partly with uni'ntentional mistakes.
ln this manner we may distinguish three classes ol manuscripts
-namely, 1. Ancient and faithful copies, without intentioual cor·
restions, but sometimes unintelligible, because the original manu·
script itsels was in some parts saulty or illegible, 2. Manuscripts
which betraythe eorrecting hand os the abovektnentioned scholar,
but are otherwise written with tolerable accuracy3 ³. Manuscripts
which are based upon the⁴ revised copy, but are disligured by
numerous mistakes, arising partly from arbitrary emendations,
and partly from carelessness.
