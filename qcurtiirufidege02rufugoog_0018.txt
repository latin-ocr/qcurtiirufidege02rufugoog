the ilva most ancientrhetorieians ars all mathaee come down to
ua: the continuatim, which, according to the index, should con-
taiu the lives of elenen rhetoricians, particularly Nn. 6, that ol
L caestius Pius, No. ⁷, that of Μ. Porcina Latro, No. 8, thet os
0, Curtius Rufus, dte. dcc, is lost‘and no other notice os this
rhetorician existe· A second person cithia nante is the con·
eular Curtius Ruths mentioned in Pliny, Epist. vii. 27, and espe-
eially in Tacitus, ‚dan- xi. 20. It ia related ol him that he rose
from tha humblest audon, through the support cs his pattena aud
his own energetie eloquenca, to the dignity ol a senator; and
Tiberius himself (who reigned l'rorn the year nu. 14 to 37) pro·
rnoted him to the praetorship, and afterwards even made him
consul (namely, ruffedur); and in the year nn. 4⁷ he received
the brigeio triumphalia aa commender oi the Roman army on
the Upper Rhine; and at last was made proconsul os Africa-
the highest honour a Roman snoesman could attain under the
emperora; in which office he died at an advanoed age, probably
in the year nn. tt Itis unknown whether these two rnen
named Curtius Rufus were related or nor: we might have known
bad Tacitus, in the above-mentioned passage, expressed him·
sels with less reserve respecting the origin ot* the consular, ee
he says the common opinion that he was the son oi a gladia· ’
tor was wrong, but that he himsell was asharned to state the
tmth. The question now ie, whether either of thern was the
authores the litecs Alexander. It has been even asserted by
some that they were one and the same person, and that the
rhetorician Q Curtius Rufos, aller spending a lise devoted to

literature, engaged in the service of the state, but we cannot ·

possibly admit this, aa the transition from the one to the other
is so rare au occurrence, that Tacitus and Pliny, who give a tole·

rably detailed account os the consular, would necessarily have ⁵

mentioned this circumstance. We, moreover, have little doubt
that ii a Roman consular 'had written such a work, either in the
earlier years os bis literary lise, or in the leisure of a more ad·
vanced age, frequent mention would have been madens it by
contemporary authors. We therefore believe that the first-men·
honad Q„ curtius Ruhre is the author os the following work: and
ii' we hare proved above that the Roman princepe, who ia praised
in the work as tha preserver of the Roman Empire, is Augustus,
and that Curtius wrote at a time when the house of Augustus
still contained some promising young men, we rnay add that
the best period cf the rhetorician coincidet with the time ol the
urmryeenblished sovereignty ol Augustus, that is, about the
year cf the birth ct Christ Μ. Porcius Latro is the imme·
diate predecessor os Curtius in the list of rhetoricians, whose
livea Suetonius wrote, and he died, according to Hieronymus in
