we are justified in connecting the hest period 01 our author with
the year in which hie predecessor in the liet diod. It is possible,
indeed, that the consular, whose real origin Tacitus conceels from
0 feeling cf modesty, was an illegitimate son of the rhetorician.

Those scholare who suppose the author 01 the life 01 Alexander
to he either the rhetorician mentioned by Suetonius, cr the con-
sular described by Tacitus—es well as those who consider the
eulogy on the Romen princepe, x. 28, to refer to Augustus, 01
Claudius, or Vespasiae, or even, which ie still leee possible, to
Trajan-agree with ue in the opinion thet the Latin language in
the work of Curtius is worthy of all praiee. We ourselves
recognise in it the perfection of Romen literature, on account of
the perfect accuracy in the appropriate nee of separate words,
and in the syntecticel combination 01 words into clauses end
sentences. There is only one point in which a slight deviation
from the classical prose 01 Cicero arrd Cesar may be observati,
namely, that sometimes the expressions which were formerly
used only in poetry are here introduced into prose-euch as
0001011 101Ι uita or 01101, jacente for 1110111101, eumue for nedelis,
1011110011 ,· the frequent and thereby weakened uee 01 ingrat, and
of linquere for relittprtrre5 also the joining passive verbs with
the dative instead of using the proposition nh. The frequent use
01 crimen for red, in which, however, Sallust had preceded Cur-
tius, ia lihewise 0 slight deviation from the earlier Ianguage.
Other deviatione, such as the absolute use 01 the participle per·
fect passive- for instance, audito 101 quern andrum erret, witha
sentence following, the uec 01 the participle future active in oon-
nection with 0 hypothetical sentence-for instance, viii. 11, uti·
mrem 11110111 percurrente 0001001010 prohibitus aret, should he
considered rather ae exemplet 01 0 judicioue development 01
the languege than ae defecta, since brevity and precision 01 ex·
pressiori are therehy promoted. The speeches, in particular,
which Curtius, agresebly to the custom of the anciente end the
example 01 other historiens, interweeves into his history, are
distinguished for their energetic eloquence, and 101 the 0 ppropri-
atenese in the characters 01 the speakers, from which circum-
stance we rney infer the rhetorical activity 01 the author, and
hie intention to produce 0 work with specimsns os his shill. He
had in this respect, end indeed in the whole composition 01
his history, a model in the Greek work of Clitarchus, 0 cele·
brated historiari, who lived soon atter the death of Alexander,
and was much praised by the anciente for his rhetorical powers,
though he was suspected of credulity, especially in his descrip-
tion 01 the wonders of 101 distent countries. The same desecte,
accordingly, ere found iu our Latin author, hut it meet he
